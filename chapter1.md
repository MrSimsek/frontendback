# How Internet works?
This is something normal people either tend to ignore or think it's magic (which kind of is).

- What happens when we enter a website and surf through its pages?

In this chapter, I will try to demonstrate a simple **request-response** cycle.

## Request
When I want to surf Google, I need to type www.google.com to the address bar of any browser application.

## Response
After my request, Google sends me thier response and they show me the content in mt browser window.

![Google's response.](https://preview.ibb.co/dRLYMo/Fire_Shot_Capture_1_Google_https_www_google_com.png "Google webpage in browser window")

It may sound weird but when I did that, I actually requested to see the **content stored in an another computer**.
